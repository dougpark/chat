# Chat

## Summary
A browser based chat application using PHP, Ajax and Javascript along with a host of supporting tools...HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Jquery 3.5.1, MySQL and of course a websever like Apache on a server host like Linux. On the client you need a modern webbrowser like Safari or Chrome. Works on iOS, macOS and Windows. I'm sure it works on a standard Linux client because it works on a Raspberry Pi 4.

## PHP
Tested on PHP 7.3.8

## Database
Tested on MySQL 5.7.26
